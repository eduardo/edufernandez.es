title: Show hidden files in Finder
date: 04/08/2010

By convention all files starting with a dot (.) is hidden in Mac OS X. To view these files open terminal and type the following:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/508298.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script>

This will show you all of the hidden files and folders on your operating system. If you want to reverse the command replace TRUE with FALSE.

That's all.
