title: Best of 2009
date: 08/01/2010

Perhaps a bit late, but anyway, here are ten of the best albums 2009 brought us. It was a good year. You can order them as you like, except for the first. It stays where it belongs.
*	The Antlers - Hospice
*	Sunset Rubdown - Dragonslayer
*	Grizzly Bear - Veckatimest
*	Animal Collective - Merriweather Post Pavilion
*	The Flaming Lips - Embryonic
*	Girls - Album
*	Cymbals Eat Guitars - Why There Are Mountains
*	Dinosaur Jr. - Farm
*	Baroness - Blue Record
*	Thåström - Kärlek Är För Dom
We've also entered a new decade, which means that I should probably also make up my mind about the best album of the 2000's. Off course I can't. It stands between Arcade Fire - Funeral and Radiohead - Kid A. You decide.
